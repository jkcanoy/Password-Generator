# Random Password Generator

## Description

    This is an application that provides a randomly generated password based on criterion chosen by the user. 

    When the user clicks "generate password" they are prompted to enter the length of the password between 8-128 characters. If the user inputs a number outside of that range they are given an alert and prompted to input a number again. 
    
    They are then given four confirmation prompts asking whether they would like their password to contain lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numbers, or special characters. If they click cancel on all four prompts they are given an alert that says the password must contain at least one of the parameters and will be given all four confirmations again. 
    
    The password they are given will reflect the length they have inputed and which parameters they have confirmed/canceled and will be generated in the blank box.
